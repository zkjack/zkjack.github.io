# `题目：`

`Employee`表包含所有员工信息，每个员工有其对应的Id,salary和departmentId 。

| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |

`Department`表包含公司所有部门的信息。

| Id | Name     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |

编写一个SQL查询，找出每个部门工资前三高的员工。例如，根据上述给定的表格，查询结果应返回：

| Department | Employee | Salary |
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |

# 方案一：

        SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary AS Salary
        FROM Employee e, Department d WHERE d.Id = e.DepartmentId
        AND (SELECT count(DISTINCT Salary) FROM Employee WHERE DepartmentId = d.Id AND Salary > e.Salary) < 3 
        ORDER BY Department;

# 方案二：

        SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary AS Salary
        FROM Employee e
        JOIN Department d ON d.Id = e.DepartmentId
        AND (SELECT count(DISTINCT Salary) FROM Employee WHERE DepartmentId = d.Id AND Salary > e.Salary) < 3;
